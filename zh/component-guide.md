### How to Start/Stop PostgreSQL

```
#Start the postgresql service
shell> systemctl start postgresql-13

#Stop the postgresql service
shell> systemctl stop postgresql-13

#Restart the postgresql service
shell> systemctl restart postgresql-13
```

### Connect to PostgreSQL

After creating an instance, initially connect as follows.
<br>
```
#Log in after switching the account to postgres
shell> su - postgres
shell> psql
```

### Initial Setup After Creating a PostgreSQL Instance

#### 1\. Change the Port

The provided image port is 5432, which is the PostgreSQL default port. For security reasons, it is recommended to change the port.
<br>
```
shell> vi /var/lib/pgsql/13/data/postgresql.conf


#Enter the port to use in the postgresql.conf file.

port =port name to use


#Save vi editor


#Restart the postgresql service

shell> systemctl restart postgresql-13


#Connect to the changed port as follows

shell> psql -p [changed port number]
```

#### 2\. Change the Server Log Time Zone

The default time zone logged in the server log is set to UTC. It is recommended to change it to be the same as the SYSTEM local time.
<br>
```
shell> vi /var/lib/pgsql/13/data/postgresql.conf


#Enter the time zone to use in the postgresql.conf file.

log_timezone =time zone to use


#Save vi editor


#Restart the postgresql service

shell> systemctl restart postgresql-13


#Connect to postgresql

shell> psql


#Confirm changed settings

postgres=# SHOW log_timezone;
```

#### 3\. Revoke the public Schema Privilege

By default, all users are granted CREATE and USAGE privileges for the public schema, so users who can access the database can create objects in the public schema. It is recommended to revoke the privileges to prevent all users from creating objects in the public schema.
<br>
```
#Connect to postgresql

shell> psql


#Execute the command to revoke the privilege

postgres=# REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

#### 4\. Allow Remote Access

To allow access from connections other than localhost, you need to change the listen_addresses variable and the client authentication configuration file.
<br>
```
shell> vi /var/lib/pgsql/13/data/postgresql.conf


#Specify the addresses to allow in the postgresql.conf file.
#0.0.0.0 to allow all IPv4 addresses
#:: to allow all IPv6 addresses
#* to allow any address

listen_addresses =Addresses to allow


#Save vi editor


shell> vi /var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf


#Client authentication control by IP address format
#Older client libraries do not support the scram-sha-256 method, so it needs to be changed to md5

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    Allowed DB          Allowed user         Allowed address                  scram-sha-256
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
host    Allowed DB          Allowed user         Allowed address                  scram-sha-256


#Restart the postgresql service

shell> systemctl restart postgresql-13
```

```

### Install Kafka Cluster
- Must install in a new instance.
- An odd number of instances (3 or more) are required, and the installation script is executed in the instance.
- An instance consists of of one kafka broker and one zookeeper node.
- The key pair (PEM file) required to connect to another instance must be located at the ~ path of the instance running the installation script. The key pair of cluster instances must be the same.
- Only default port installation is supported. If you need to change the port, change the port by referring to the initial settings guide after completing cluster installation.
- For Kafka-related port communication between instances, set security group as follows.

Set security group
```
Direction: Inbound
IP protocol: TCP
Port: 22, 9092, 2181, 2888, 3888
```
How to check Hostname and IP

##### Cluster Installation Complete #####
```


### Initial Setup After Creating Apache Kafka Instance
#### Change the Port
After initial installation, the ports are 9092, which is the Kafka default port, and 2181, which is the Zookeeper default port. It is recommended to change the port for security.

##### 1) Modify the ~/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties file
Open the ~/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties file and enter the Zookeeper port to change in clientPort.
```
shell> vi ~/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties

clientPort=zookeeper port to change
```
##### 2) Modify the ~/kafka/config/server.properties file
Open the ~/kafka/config/server.properties file and enter the Kafka port to change in listeners.

How to check Instance IP
```
Private IP on the console screen
or shell> hostname -i
```
```
shell> vi ~/kafka/config/server.properties

# Uncomment
listeners=PLAINTEXT://Instance IP:kafka port to change

# Change Zookeeper port
zookeeper.connect=Instance IP:zookeeper port to change
---> If it is a cluster, change Zookeeper port of each instance IP
```

##### 3) Restart Zookeeper, Kafka broker
Restart the zookeeper and the kafka for the port change to take effect.
```
shell> sudo systemctl stop kafka.service
shell> sudo systemctl stop zookeeper.service

shell> sudo systemctl start zookeeper.service
shell> sudo systemctl start kafka.service
```

##### 4) Check Zookeeper, Kafka Port Change
Check if the changed port is in use.
```
shell> netstat -ntl | grep [Kafka port]
shell> netstat -ntl | grep [Zookeeper port]
```
### Create and Use Apache Kafka Topic and Data

Create and query a topic
```
# Instance IP = Private IP / Kafka default port = 9092
# Create a topic
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --topic kafka

# Query a topic list
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT]

# Check the details of the topic
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --topic kafka

# Delete a topic
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --delete --bootstrap-server [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --topic kafka
```
Create and use data
```
# Start producer
shell> ~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list  [Instance IP]:[Kafka PORT] --topic kafka

```

## Redis

### Start/Stop Redis
```
# Start Redis
shell> sudo systemctl start redis

# Stop Redis
shell> sudo systemctl stop redis

# Restart Redis
shell> sudo systemctl restart redis
```

### Connect to Redis
Connect to a Redis instance by using the `redis-cli` command.
```
shell> redis-cli
```

### Initial Setup After Creating a Redis Instance
The default configuration file for a Redis instance is the `~/redis/redis.conf` file. The description for the parameters to be changed is as follows.

#### Bind
- Default value: `127.0.0.1 -::1`
- Changed value: `<private ip> 127.0.0.1 -::1`

Value for an IP used by Redis. To allow access to a Redis instance from outside the server, add a private IP to the parameter. You can check the private IP with the `hostname -I` command.

#### Port
- Default value: `6379`

Port is 6379, a default value for Redis. It is recommended to change the port for security reasons. After changing the port, you can connect to Redis with the following command.

```
shell> redis-cli -p <new port>
```

#### Requirepass/masterauth
- Default value: `nhncloud`

The default password is `nhncloud`. For security reasons, it is recommended to change the password. If you are using replication connection, you must change the `requirepass` and `masterauth` values at the same time.

### Automatic HA Configuration Script
A Redis instance of NHN Cloud provides a script that automatically configures an HA environment. You can use the script only for **a new instance immediately after installation**, and cannot use after changing the set values from redis.conf.

To use the script, the following settings are required.

##### Copy key pair
The instance running the installation script must have a key pair (PEM file) required to connect to other instances. The key pair can be copied as follows.
- centos
```
local> scp -i <key pair>.pem <key pair>.pem centos@<floating ip>:/home/centos/
```
- ubuntu
```
local> scp -i <key pair>.pem <key pair>.pem ubuntu@<floating ip>:/home/ubuntu/
```

The key pairs for created instances must be the same.

##### Set security group
You must set a security group (**Network** > **Security Groups**) for communication between Redis instances. Create a security group with the following rules and apply it to a Redis instance.

| Direction | IP protocol | Port range| Ether| Remote|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inbound |TCP | 6379| IPv4| Instance IP(CIDR)|
| Inbound |TCP | 16379| IPv4| Instance IP(CIDR)|
| Inbound |TCP | 26379| IPv4| Instance IP(CIDR)|

#### Sentinel Automatic Configuration
You will need 3 Redis instances to configure Sentinel. After copying the key pair to the instance used as the master, run the script as follows.

```
shell> sh .redis_make_sentinel.sh
```

Enter the private IPs of the master and replica in turn. You can check the private IP of each instance with the `hostname -I` command.

```
shell> sh .redis_make_sentinel.sh
Enter Master's IP: 192.168.0.33
Enter Replica-1's IP: 192.168.0.27
Enter Replica-2's IP: 192.168.0.97
```

Enter the file name of the copied key pair.
```
shell> Enter Pemkey's name: <key pair>.pem
```

#### Cluster Automatic Configuration
6 Redis instances are required for Cluster configuration. After copying the key pair to the instance used as the master, run the script as follows.

```
shell> sh .redis_make_cluster.sh
```

Enter the private IPs of Redis instances used for a cluster in turn. You can check the private IP of each instance with the `hostname -I` command.

```
shell> sh .redis_make_cluster.sh
Enter cluster-1'IP:  192.168.0.79
Enter cluster-2'IP: 192.168.0.10
Enter cluster-3'IP: 192.168.0.33
Enter cluster-4'IP:  192.168.0.116
Enter cluster-5'IP:  192.168.0.91
Enter cluster-6'IP:  192.168.0.32
```

Enter the file name of the copied key pair.

```
shell> Enter Pemkey's name: <key pair>.pem
```

Enter `yes` to complete cluster configuration.
```

## JEUS, WebtoB

> [Note]
> This guide is based on JEUS 8 Fxi#1 and WebtoB 5 Fix4.
> If you are using a different version, please change the commands accordingly.

Each image script installs DAS, MS, and WebtoB after installing JDK.
For how to set up and control the services after installation, refer to TmaxSoft's guide document ([JEUS](https://technet.tmaxsoft.com/upload/download/online/jeus/pver-20190227-000001/index.html), [WebtoB](https://technet.tmaxsoft.com/upload/download/online/webtob/pver-20201021-000001/index.html)).

### Install Images

The JDK will be installed in `~/apps/jdk8u292`, and a link will be created from that directory to `~/apps/jdk8`.
During the JDK installation process, the path `~/apps/jdk8/bin` is added to `PATH` in `.bash_profile`.
If you already have a `~/apps/jdk8` directory, the JDK will not be installed.

#### JEUS DAS, MS

JEUS is installed in `~/apps/jeus8`.


The following properties are set during installation.

| Property | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| Domain name | jeus_domain |
| WebAdmin port | 9736 |
| Admin server name | adminServer |
| Admin user ID | administrator |
| Admin user password | jeusadmin |
| Node manager | java |

#### WebtoB

WebtoB is installed in `~/apps/webtob`.

### Check JEUS, WebtoB Startup

#### JEUS

To configure or control JEUS, start the node manager and then control it through WebAdmin or jeusadmin.

##### Start the Node Manager

Connect to the shell and run the node manager with the startNodeManager command.
Since the node managers need to communicate with each other, add an allow rule for the default port 7730 to the security group.

##### Start JEUS

Run DAS with the startDomainAdminServer command.
```
startDomainAdminServer -uadministrator -pjeusadmin
```

##### JEUS WebAdmin

Run WebAdmin as follows:

1. Set a floating IP on the instance where DAS is installed.
2. Add an allow rule for port 9736 to that instance's security group.
3. If you connect to `http://{floating IP}:9736/webadmin` in a web browser, you can see the WebAdmin screen.


#### WebtoB

Compile the configuration file using the wscfl command.
```
wscfl -i http.m
```

Start WebtoB using wsboot.
```
wsboot
```

You can use wsadmin to view or control the status.

## Apache Tomcat

### Default Location
The installation path of Tomcat is as follows.

```
~/apps/apache-tomcat-{version}/
```

### How to Start/Stop Tomcat

Tomcat is registered as a service by default during the initial installation process and is automatically started when the instance starts. You can use the command below to manually start or stop Tomcat.

``` sh
#Start the tomcat service
shell> sudo systemctl start tomcat

#Stop the tomcat service
shell> sudo systemctl stop tomcat

#Restart the tomcat service
shell> sudo systemctl restart tomcat
```

### Access the Tomcat Default Page
Tomcat runs on port 8080, which is the default from initial installation. You can access the Tomcat default page by running the following command:

```sh
shell> curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
...
```

### Initial Setup After Creating a Tomcat Instance

#### 1\. Change the Port
It runs with the default settings configured during initial installation. For security reasons, it is recommended to change the port.

##### 1) Modify the `server.xml` file

Open the `~/apps/apache-tomcat-{version}/conf/server.xml` file and enter the port address to change in \<Connector\>, as follows:

```sh
shell> vi ~/apps/apache-tomcat-{version}/conf/server.xml
```

```xml
...
<Connector port="{Port address to change}" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
            connectionTimeout="20000"
            redirectPort="8443" />
...
```

##### 2) Restart the service
Restart the Tomcat service for the port change to take effect.
```
shell> sudo systemctl restart tomcat
```

## Node.js

```
$ conda info --envs
# conda environments:
#
                         /opt/intel/oneapi/intelpython/latest
                         /opt/intel/oneapi/intelpython/latest/envs/2021.4.0
base                  *  /root/miniconda3
pt_py38                  /root/miniconda3/envs/pt_py38
tf2_py38                 /root/miniconda3/envs/tf2_py38
```

### How to Use TensorFlow

First, activate the TensorFlow environment.

```
(base) root@b64e6a035884:~# conda activate tf2_py38
(tf2_py38) root@b64e6a035884:~#
```

Test TensorFlow training as follows:

```
$ cd ~/
$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
$ cd models
$ git checkout tags/v2.4.0
$ git status
HEAD detached at v2.4.0
nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ mkdir $HOME/models/model
$ mkdir $HOME/models/dataset
$ vim train.sh
#!/bin/bash


export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/models
export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO
MODEL_DIR=$HOME/models/model
DATA_DIR=$HOME/models/dataset
# Set when one or more GPU is used
NUM_GPUS=1 # Example: NUM_GPUS=2

python $HOME/models/official/vision/image_classification/mnist_main.py \
  --model_dir=$MODEL_DIR \
  --data_dir=$DATA_DIR \
  --train_epochs=2 \
  --distribution_strategy=mirrored \ # Set when one or more GPU is used
  --num_gpus=$NUM_GPUS \ # Set when one or more GPU is used
  --download

$ chmod +x train.sh
$ ./train.sh
```

## Slurm

This component installs and sets up the MUNGE package, and installs the Slurm package. For details on how to run Slurm, see [Slurm Installation Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart_admin.html).

>[Note]
>
>All commands included in this section must be executed with the root privilege.

### Preparation

#### 1. Modify the `hosts` file

Open the `/etc/hosts` file and enter the IP and alias of the node to be configured in the cluster environment.

``` console
# vi /etc/hosts
```

#### 2. Modify the `hostname` file

Open the `/etc/hostname` file and match the alias of the current node with the alias in the `hosts` file.

``` console
# vi /etc/hostname
```


### Cluster Configuration and Slurm Settings

There is no default configuration applied initially, so you must write a configuration file. Write the configuration by referring to [Slurm Configuration Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart_admin.html#Config) and [Slurm Configuration Tool](https://slurm.schedmd.com/configurator.html), and save it in `/etc/slurm/slurm.conf` file.

The log file path must be specified as a directory under the `/var/log/slurm/` path. If you want to specify a different path, you must specify the path in the configuration file and match the owner of the directory with the `SlurmUser` setting value.


### Running Slurm

You must configure all of the clusters and set the configuration before running Slurm. For more information, see [Slurm Installation Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart_admin.html) and [Slurm Quick Start Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html).


## NHN Kubernetes Service(NKS) Worker Node
