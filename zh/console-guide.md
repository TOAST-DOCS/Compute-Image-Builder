> [Note]
> As of January 2022, only Linux OS and user scripts in shell script format are supported.

<br/>

> [Note]
> User scripts run with the default user account. If a user script includes commands that require a root privilege, you must configure the script to run the command to gain the privilege first.
> The first line of the user script must start with a shebang. In general, `#!/bin/bash -e` is used.
> An error in the user script can cause the image build to fail. To determine the cause of the error, see the detailed log in the **Build Details** window.
